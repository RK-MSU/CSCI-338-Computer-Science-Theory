# Ch.1 - Regular Languages

In beginning to describe the mathematical theory of finite automatan, we do so in the abstract, without reference to any particular application.

## Finite Automata

[See p.55](`r book_url`#page=55)

(ref:finite-automaton-m1-cap) A finite automaton called $M_{1}$ that has three states

```{r finite-automaton-m1, fig.cap='(ref:finite-automaton-m1-cap)', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("assets/images/1.4-state-diagram-finite-automaton.png"))
```

This is called a ***state diagram***. It has three ***states***, labeled q1 , q2 ,
and q3 . The ***start state***, q1 , is indicated by the arrow pointing at it from nowhere.
The ***accept state***, q2 , is the one with a double circle. The arrows going from one
state to another are called ***transitions***.

The output is either ***accept*** or ***reject***. The output is
*accept* if it is now in an accept state and *reject* if it is not.


For example, when we feed the input string 1101 into the machine:

1. Start in state $q_{1}$.
2. Read 1, follow transition from $q_{1}$ to $q_{2}$.
3. Read 1, follow transition from $q_{2}$ to $q_{2}$.
4. Read 0, follow transition from $q_{2}$ to $q_{3}$.
5. Read 1, follow transition from $q_{3}$ to $q_{2}$.
6. *Accept* because $M_{1}$ is in an accept state $q_{2}$ at the end of the input.


### Formal Definition of a Finite Automaton

[See p.59](`r book_url`#page=59){target="_blank"}


A finite automaton has several parts.

- It has a set of states and rules for going from one state to another, depending on the input symbol.
- It has an input alphabet that indicates the allowed input symbols.
- It has a start state and a set of accept states.


The formal definition says that a finite automaton is a list of those
five objects: set of states, input alphabet, rules for moving, start state, and accept
states.


We use something called a ***transition function***, frequently denoted $\delta$, to define the rules for moving.
If the finite automaton has an arrow from a state x
to a state y labeled with the input symbol 1, that means that if the automaton is
in state x when it reads $a_{1}$, it then moves to state y. We can indicate the same
thing with the transition function by saying that $\delta(x, 1) = y$.


```{definition finite-automaton, name="Finite Automaton"}
A **finite automaton** is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F)$, where

1. $Q$ is a finite set called the **states**,
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabet**,
3. $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is the **transition function**,
4. $q_{0} \in Q$ is the **start state**, and
5. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of **accept states**.
```

The formal definition precisely describes what we mean by a finite automaton.

- $F$ can be set to an empty set ($\emptyset$)
- $\delta$ specifies exactly one next state for each possible combination of a state and an input symbol. Exactly one transition arrow exits every state for each possible input symbol.

We can describe $M_{1}$ \@ref(fig:finite-automaton-m1) formally by writing $M_{1} = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{1}, F)$, where

1. $Q = \{ q_{1} , q_{2} , q_{3}\}$,
2. $\Sigma = \{0, 1 \}$,
3. $\delta$ is described as `r newLine()`
```{r finite-automaton-m1-delta-descript, out.width="20%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("assets/images/1.6-3-delta.png"))
```
4. $q_{1}$ is the start state, and
5. $F = \{ q_{2} \}$.



If $A$ is the set of all strings that machine $M_{1}$ accepts, we say that $A$ is the
***language of machine $M$*** and write $L( M_{1} ) = A$. We say that ***M recognizes A*** or
that ***M accepts A***.

Because the term *accept* has different meanings when we refer
to machines accepting strings and machines accepting languages, we prefer the
term *recognize* for languages in order to avoid confusion.




In our example, let

$$A = \{ w| w \text{ contains at least one 1 and an even number of 0s follow the last 1 }\}.$$
Then $L(M_{1}) = A$, or equivalently, $M_{1}$ recognizes $A$.




### Formal Definition of Computation

[See p.64](`r book_url`#page=64)

Let M = $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F)$ be a finite automaton and let $w = w_{1}w_{2} \cdots w_{n}$ be
a string where each w i is a member of the alphabet $\Sigma$. Then $M$ ***accepts*** $w$ if a
sequence of states $r_{0},r_{1}, \ldots , r_{n}$ in $Q$ exists with three conditions:

1. $r_{0} = q_{0}$,
2. $\delta (r_{i}, w_{i+1}) = r_{i+1}$, for $i = 0, \ldots , n − 1$, and
3. $r_{n} \in F$.

Condition 1 says that the machine starts in the start state. Condition 2 says
that the machine goes from state to state according to the transition function.
Condition 3 says that the machine accepts its input if it ends up in an accept
state. We say that M ***recognizes language*** $A$ if $A = \{ w \mid M \text{ accepts } w\}$.


```{definition regular-language, name='Regular Language'}
A language is called a ***regular language*** if some finite automaton recognizes it.
```


### Designing Finite Automata


> Whether it be of automaton or artwork, design is a creative process. As such,
it cannot be reduced to a simple recipe or formula. However, you might find
a particular approach helpful when designing various types of automata. That
is, put *yourself* in the place of the machine you are trying to design and then see
how you would go about performing the machine's task. Pretending that you are
the machine is a psychological trick that helps engage your whole mind in the
design process.
`r newLine()`
`r newLine()`
Let's design a finite automaton using the “reader as automaton” method just
described. Suppose that you are given some language and want to design a finite
automaton that recognizes it. Pretending to be the automaton, you receive an
input string and must determine whether it is a member of the language the
automaton is supposed to recognize. You get to see the symbols in the string
one by one. After each symbol, you must decide whether the string seen so far is
in the language. The reason is that you, like the machine, don't know when the
end of the string is coming, so you must always be ready with the answer.
`r newLine()`
`r newLine()`
First, in order to make these decisions, you have to figure out what you need
to remember about the string as you are reading it. Why not simply remember
all you have seen? Bear in mind that you are pretending to be a finite automaton
and that this type of machine has only a finite number of states, which means
a finite memory. Imagine that the input is extremely long—say, from here to
the moon—so that you could not possibly remember the entire thing. You have
a finite memory—say, a single sheet of paper—which has a limited storage capacity. Fortunately, for many languages you don't need to remember the entire
input. You need to remember only certain crucial information. Exactly which
information is crucial depends on the particular language considered.

### The Regular Operations

[See p68](`r book_url`#page=68){target="_blank"}

In arithmetic, the basic objects are numbers and the tools are operations for manipulating them, such as $+$ and $\times$. In the theory of computation, the objects are languages and the tools include operations specifically designed for manipulating them. We define three operations on languages, called the ***regular operations***, and use them to study properties of the regular languages.


(ref:reg-ops-union) $A \cup B = \{ x \mid \times \in A \text{ or } \times \in B \}$

(ref:reg-ops-concat) $A \circ B = \{ xy \mid \times \in A \text{ and } y \in B \}$

(ref:reg-ops-star) $A^{*} = \{ x_{1}x_{2} \ldots x_{k} \mid k \geq 0 \text{ and each } x_{i} \in A \}$

```{definition regular-opertions-union-concat-star, name="Regular Operations"}
Let A and B be languages. We define the regular operations ***union***, ***concatenation***, and ***star*** as follows:
  
- **Union**: (ref:reg-ops-union).
- **Concatenation**: (ref:reg-ops-concat).
- **Star**: (ref:reg-ops-star).
```


`r newLine()`
`r newLine()`

- You are already familiar with the union operation. It simply takes all the strings in both A and B and lumps them together into one language.
- The concatenation operation is a little trickier. It attaches a string from *A* in front of a string from B in all possible ways to get the strings in the new language.
- The star operation is a bit different from the other two because it applies to a single language rather than to two different languages. That is, the star operation is a ***unary operation*** instead of a ***binary operation***. It works by attaching any number of strings in A together to get a string in the new language. Because “any number” includes 0 as a possibility, the empty string $\varepsilon$ is always a member of A ∗ , no matter what A is.


`r newLine()`
`r newLine()`
```{example regular-operations-example, name="Regular Operations"}
Let the alphabet $\Sigma$ be the standard 26 letters $\{a, b, \ldots , z\}$. If $A = \{ good, bad \}$ and $B = \{ boy, girl \}$, then

- $A \cup B = \{ good, bad, boy, girl \}$,
- $A \circ B = \{ goodboy, goodgirl, badboy, badgirl \}$, and
- $A^{*}=$ \{ $\varepsilon$ *, good, bad, goodgood, goodbad, badgood, badbad, goodgoodgood, goodgoodbad, goodbadgood, goodbadbad,* $\ldots$ \}.
```
`r newLine()`
`r newLine()`


(ref:closed-under-multiplication) Let $N = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$ be the set of natural numbers. When we say that $N$ is *closed under multiplication*, we mean that for any $x$ and $y$ in $N$, the product $x \times y$ also is in $N$.

(ref:closed-under-multiplication)
In contrast, $N$ is not closed under division, as 1 and 2 are in $N$ but 1/2 is not. Generally speaking, a collection of objects is ***closed*** under some operation if applying that operation to members of the collection returns an object still in the collection.


#### The Regular Languages is Closed Under the Union Operation

In other words, if $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are regular languages, so is $A_{1} \cup A_{2}$.

**Proof Idea**: We have regular languages $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ and want to show that
$A_{1} \cup A_{2}$ also is regular. Because $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are regular, we know that some finite
automaton $M_{1}$ recognizes $A_{1}$ and some finite automaton $M_{2}$ recognizes $A_{2}$. To
prove that $A_{1} \cup A_{2}$ is regular, we demonstrate a finite automaton, call it $M$, that
recognizes $A_{1} \cup A_{2}$.

This is a proof by construction. We construct $M$ from $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. Machine
M must accept its input exactly when either $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ would accept it in order
to recognize the union language. It works by simulating both $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ and
accepting if either of the simulations accept.

How can we make machine $M$ simulate $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$? Perhaps it first simulates
$M_{1}$ on the input and then simulates $M_{2}$ on the input. But we must be careful
here! Once the symbols of the input have been read and used to simulate $M_{1}$,
we can't “rewind the input tape” to try the simulation on $M_{2}$. We need another
approach.

Pretend that you are $M$. As the input symbols arrive one by one, you simulate
both $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ simultaneously. That way, only one pass through the input is
necessary. But can you keep track of both simulations with finite memory? All
you need to remember is the state that each machine would be in if it had read
up to this point in the input. Therefore, you need to remember a pair of states.
How many possible pairs are there? If $M_{1}$ has $k_{1}$ states and $M_{2}$ has $k_{2}$ states, the
number of pairs of states, one from $M_{1}$ and the other from $M_{2}$, is the product
$k_{1} \times k_{2}$. This product will be the number of states in $M$, one for each pair. The
transitions of $M$ go from pair to pair, updating the current state for both $M_{1}$ and
$M_{2}$. The accept states of $M$ are those pairs wherein either $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ is in an
accept state.


***PROOF***: [See p.70](`r book_url`#page=70)


## Nondeterminism

[See p.71](`r book_url`#page=71)

Nondeterminism is a useful concept that has had great impact on the theory of
computation. So far in our discussion, every step of a computation follows in a
unique way from the preceding step. When the machine is in a given state and
reads the next input symbol, we know what the next state will be—it is determined. We call this ***deterministic*** computation. In a ***nondeterministic*** machine,
several choices may exist for the next state at any point.

- every deterministic finite automaton is automatically a nondeterministic finite automaton
- First, every state of a DFA always has exactly one exiting transition arrow for each symbol in the alphabet
  - NFA, this is not true
- In an NFA , a state may have zero, one, or many exiting arrows for each alphabet symbol.

Second, in a DFA, labels on the transition arrows are symbols from the alphabet. This NFA has an arrow with the label $\epsilon$. In general, an NFA may have arrows labeled with members of the alphabet or $\epsilon$. Zero, one, or many arrows may exit from each state with the label $\epsilon$.




## Regular Expressions

[See p.87](`r book_url`#page=87)

- A language is said to be a Regular Language if and only if some Finite State Machine recognizes it.
  - NOT REGULAR is the FSM requires memory, or require the storing of strings


## Nonregular Expressions

[See p.101](`r book_url`#page=101)

To understand the power of finite automata, you must also understand their
limitations.

Example:

- Let's take the language $B = \{ 0^{n}1^{n} \mid n \geq 0 \}$.
- If we attempt to find a DFA
that recognizes B, we discover that the machine seems to need to remember
how many 0s have been seen so far as it reads the input. Because the number of
0s isn't limited, the machine will have to keep track of an unlimited number of
possibilities. But it cannot do so with any finite number of states.

but other languages seem to require an unlimited number of
possibilities, yet actually they are regular. For example, consider two languages
over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \}$:

- $C = \{ w \mid w \text{ has an equal number of 0s and 1s} \}$, and
- $D = \{ w \mid w \text{ has an equal number of ocurrences of 01 and 10 as substrings} \}$.

At first glance, a recognizing machine appears to need to count in each case,
and therefore neither language appears to be regular. As expected, $C$ is not
regular, but surprisingly $D$ is regular!

### The Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages

__Pumping Lemma__: all regular languages have a special property. If we can show that a language does not have this property, we are guaranteed that it is not regular.


```{theorem pumping-lemma, name="Pumping Lemma"}

If A is a regular language, then there is a number p (the pumping length) where if s is any string in A of length at least p, then s may be divided into three pieces, s = xyz, satisfying the following conditions:
  
1. for each $i \geq 0, xy^{i}z \in A$,
2. $|y| > 0$, and
3. $|xy| \leq p$.

```


#### To prove that a language is not Regular using PUMPING LEMMA, follow these steps:

__(We prove using Contradiction)__

1. Assume that $A$ is Regular
2. It has to have a Pumping Length
3. All strings longer that $P$ can be pumped $|S| \geq P$
4. Now find a string '$S$' in $A$ such that $|S| \geq P$
5. Divide $S$ in $xyz$
6. Show that $xy^{i}x \notin A$ for some $i$
7. The consider all ways that $S$ can be divided into $xyz$
8. Show that none of these can satisfy all 3 of the pumping conditions at the same time
9. $S$ cannot be Pumped == CONTRADICTION
