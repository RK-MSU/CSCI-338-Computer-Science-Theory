%When writing up your solution, comment out the following until you reach Problem 1.
\noindent
This assignment is due on {\bf Monday, April 19, 8:00pm}. It is strongly
encouraged that you use Latex to generate a single pdf file and upload it
under {\em Assignment 6} on D2L. But there will NOT be a penalty for not
using Latex (to finish the assignment). This {\bf could} be a
group-assignment, and you can form a group of at most 2 people (you must put
both names on the group assignment and it is enough for one of the 2 students
to submit it); certainly, you can also finish the assignment all by yourself.
